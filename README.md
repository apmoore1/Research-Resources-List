# Research-Resources-List
A list of blog posts and videos on how to present, review, write rebuttals, and collaboration. This list is heavily biased towards blog post and videos that I have found within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community and is not an extensive list.

The List below is all of the conferences and their associated acronyms that are used throughout the list:
* [ACL](https://aclanthology.info/venues/acl) - Association for Computational Linguistic. In the contexts of this list it refers to the conference series rather than the society.
* [NAACL](https://aclanthology.info/venues/naacl) - North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
* [COLING](https://aclanthology.info/venues/coling) - International Committee on Computational Linguistics.

## Reviewing
* A great [NLP highlights podcast](https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights) that featured [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) describing his thoughts on reviewing: [**LINK**](https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights/77-on-writing-quality-peer-reviews-with-noah-a-smith)

* [Nanna Inie](https://twitter.com/NannaInie) advice, compared to the others this contains different ways of creating your slides as well as general advice. Also contains advice on how to create a **poster**. This was part of the [COLING 2018 PC blog series](http://coling2018.org/category/pc-blog/): [**LINK**](http://coling2018.org/presenting-your-academic-work-at-a-conference-applicable-tips-and-advice/)

## Rebuttals
* The approach on how to write rebuttals for [COLING 2018](http://coling2018.org/pc-blog/) by [Emily M. Bender](http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/): [**LINK**](http://coling2018.org/author-response/)
* The [CVPR 2020 tutorial How to write a good review?](https://sites.google.com/view/making-reviews-great-again/home) from the reviewing section above also includes a session on how to write a good rebuttal.
* [How we write rebuttals](https://medium.com/@deviparikh/how-we-write-rebuttals-dc84742fece1) by [Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/), [Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/), and [Stefan Lee](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/) (blog post written May 2020). They highlight that rebuttals are for two audiences the reviewers and the area chairs therefore when writing the rebuttals we need to take into account these two difference audiences. Their short hand recommended overview is "would a neutral third-party be able to tell if the reviewer concerns were addressed purely based on your rebuttal (without reading the paper or the reviews again)?"

## Publishing
* Slides by [Sam Bowman](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/) from NYU on how to find related work, setup experiments and analysis the results for an NLP paper but a lot of the slides are applicable I think to ML papers in general as well. Slides [**HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kUarnxZNa-ojz0KvZFmHeAEFwTkEH7lg/edit) 
* Great Slides by [Nando de Freitas](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/) et al. from [Deep Learning Indaba 2018](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/2018.html) on how to write/structure a paper. Slides [**HERE**](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/uploads/1/0/2/6/102657286/research-paper-writing.pdf?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
* Blog post on [how to write a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02918-5?utm_campaign=NLP%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), tips from Cormac McCarthyâ€™s by Van Savage and Pamela Yeh - to briefy summarise some of the points made; keep what your writing simple, have a theme of 2-3 points that you want the audience to take away, make paragraphs so that they just have one message to give away, and try to keep the flow of the writing by avoiding footnotes and other distractions such as badly placed equations. 

## Collaboration
* Christopher Olah's thoughts on [collaboration and credit when writing joint papers](https://colah.github.io/posts/2019-05-Collaboration/). A really great read for anybody wanting to or are currently working on projects with multiple authors, also points out the importance of "taking care of yourself" during these collaborative projects.
